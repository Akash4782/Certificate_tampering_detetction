blockchain_data.json
# (Allowing blockchain_data.json if user intends to keep history, but usually local DBs are ignored. 
# Given previous context, it's a file-based blockchain. I'll IGNORE it to simulate fresh deploy, 
# or INCLUDE it if they want persistence. 
# git status showed it as 'modified', so it IS tracked. I will NOT ignore it for now to avoid altering their workflow too much, 
# but usually bad practice. Wait, I'll ignore it to be safe for production? 
# No, user wants to 'upload THIS project'. I'll let it stay tracked if it was already tracked.)
